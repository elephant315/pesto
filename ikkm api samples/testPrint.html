Microsoft is going into the legal 
marijuana business by teaming with 
a weed financing startup called "Kind," according 
to the New York Times. The two companies will create Azure-powered cloud 
apps that track plants from 
"seed to sale," helping 
legal dealers comply with 
laws. The decision to enter the trade was probably not 
taken lightly by Microsoft, 
as most corporations still 
won't touch it with a 
ten-foot bong.
